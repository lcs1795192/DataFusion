The dataset is linked to the journal article 10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2021.122084.
The operating condition is Q = 80 mL/min and T0 = 80 degC.
The raw data was normalized by initial temperature T0 = 80 degC and ambient temperature Ta = 20 degC (see section 2 Method for detail).
The size of the matrix is 500*100000 (see Appendix 1 for detail).
